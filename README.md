# README

## Overview

This project has a Python file with a few small functions you need to complete.
Each function has a **TODO** comment telling you what it should do â€” like counting items, adding numbers, or finding vowels in a string.

Once you finish the functions, you can run tests to check your work.

---

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Save your file as `test_loops.py` in your project folder.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run this command to test it:



```bash
python -m unittest test_loops.py
```

## What Each Function Should Do

| Function                          | What it should return                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `count_items(items)`              | The number of items in a list                    |
| `sum_numbers(numbers)`            | The sum of all numbers                           |
| `find_largest(numbers)`           | The largest number in the list                   |
| `count_even_numbers(numbers)`     | How many even numbers are in the list            |
| `sum_digits(number)`              | The sum of all digits in a number                |
| `count_vowels(string)`            | The number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a string |
| `multiply_list_elements(numbers)` | The product of all numbers in the list           |

## Example Run

```bash
python test_loops.py
```

**Example output:**

```
All tests passed!
```

or

```
Test failed: find_largest()
```

Keep fixing the functions until all tests pass.
